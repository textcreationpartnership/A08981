            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14124:3"/> the one, and to deuoure the other. The fearefull hee affrighteth with dread of torment: whence it is, that <hi>Peter</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his profeſsion which he made ſo boldly, for ſweareth his Sauiour, euen with curſing most vnfaithfully. Thus many miſcarrie in time of triall: they either preſuming, and God not aſsiſting, or they formerly ſeeming to be what they were not, are then manifest to be as they were in deede.</p>
            <p>But where by feare hee cannot make afraid, he turneth his ſhape: of a Lion roaring, he would ſeeme a lambe lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: when by force hee cannot winne, he endeuoureth by deceit to beguile: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Satan would be a Sauiour, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Eue</hi> that following his counſell, ſhe ſhall be more like God then before, whilest hee intendeth to make her as himſelfe, hopeleſſe of heauen.

Hee that in ſuch a caſe is careleſſe, is growne vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and deuoid of grace. In times heretofore we reade, that the Church of God was in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie high degree vexed: firſt, with bloodie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: then by Antichriſtian ſuperſtition and idolatry. This cauſed by Antichriſt, who with Egyptian darkeneſſe obſcured the veritie of God, and obtruded a falſe word and worſhip vpon the Church. The other by the ſtumbling Iewes, and fooliſh Grecians, in the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Goſpell; but both of the diuell. The firſt was to keep out the truth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning, by afflicting bodily death: the latter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb facs="tcp:14124:6"/> it, being brought in by mens deuices, to ſoules damnation. The extreme rage of both is abated. Enemies yet muſt be, to keepe men watchfull; trials alſo, to ſee our own ſoundnes: but Satan is chained from riſing heereafter to the former meaſure of his malice; and Anti-Chriſts power ſhall neuer ſo preuaile as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: thereof perſwade thy ſelfe. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God is eſtabliſhed; let men conſult and intend what they pleaſe; in ſpight of man the purpoſe of God ſhall be permanent.</p>
            <p>There remaineth neuertheleſſe an other miſchiefe, nothing leſſe dangerous; which is, Atheiſticall ſecuritie, carnall liuing vnder a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall profeſſion in an euill peace.

            <p>Other nations are full of examples: and of this miſerie may we alſo lament: much ſin, and thereupon fearefull iudgement; but little ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and leſſe amending without greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement.

And in this beginneth Browniſme: the firſt ſtone of that ſchiſmaticall building, vpon which are laid thoſe other errors mentioned in this booke. This (Reader) take notice of, to diſcerne where Browniſme beginneth. They propound the reformed Churches gouernment to allure thee, and our ſtate ſo, as they may make thee forſake it: when neither this is the ſimple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they depart, nor the other their cauſe properly, wherein they ſtand. By theſe they doe onely make way for ſuch as know not their way, which they haue by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to come to them: but the gouernement of the reformed Churches doe not they maintaine.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe (Reader) that thou maieſt not be deceiued hereafter, either with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of ſuch trueths as be not their owne, or yet with their equiuocating renunciation of Browniſme, I, a little one amongſt others, and in the preſence of my Brethren; not with <hi>Sauls</hi> armour, but with a ſtone in a ſling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen with my meane mediocritie, haue nakedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered vnto thee this way. If thou doſt affect it, before thou runne, vncaſe it; take from the Iay, other birds fethers: ſet it before thee as it differeth from all other Churches, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it with both eyes, iudge by deliberate conſultation, and take as thou by the word haſt warrant.</p>
            <p>I haue ſought out and found, and after my
<pb facs="tcp:14124:7"/> iudgement leading will I goe, and not runne after affection: as I am perſwaded, ſo would I haue other, if I be found in the trueth: if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I promiſe not to contend for any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. Confidence in our cauſe, (that here is a true Church of God, from which wee may not make ſeparation) hath made me aduenturous: and the ſpirituall iniurie which ſome of late haue done to mee, more then to many, hath called me hereunto. They haue taken away part of the ſeale of my miniſterie. Mine owne with them may haue Inſtructors, but no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for in Chriſt Ieſus I haue begotten them through the Goſpell. I wil claime them, though vnnaturally and vnkindly they diſclaime me; in loue doe I follow, and ſo will, albeit they flee from me with hatred. Friendly Reader, when thou haſt read this <hi>huc and crie,</hi> ſend it away by thy approbation thereto, and report the cauſe to other for diſcouerie thereof, as thou ſhalt thinke fit. If thou happily doſt find any meeke ones of them in thy way, rebuke them louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intreating the Younglings gently for the Lords ſake, and ſend them backe againe. For in a ſchiſme many may be, who are not therof: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affect that where of they cannot iudge, &amp; ſo are miſlead; yet without any intendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of euil. The humble that are of a tender conſcience, are very reclaimable: but the <hi>ſtrait hearted</hi> opinionate are not ſo recouerable; yet I hope of both: for it is the Lord that worketh the will and the deed, both when and as he will.</p>
            <p>Thus (louing Reader) thou ſeeſt what I only intend: how men will take it, I well know not; how they ſhould, I know. If any thing be ſet
<pb facs="tcp:14124:8"/> downe which may any way giue offence, as not ſeeming to be without ſome gall of bitterneſſe in the manner of handling, and nothing doth touch the matter of the argument; I profeſſe, as I looke for a bleſſing, I haue not intended to abuſe any mans perſon, but to open the cauſe. I leaue men to iudge, the wiſe as they find, the peruerſe as they pleaſe. This I onely craue, that no man take ill any thing without iuſt cauſe, and that euery one expound well a mans meaning, as charitie ſhall leade him, and right reaſon perſwade him. And ſo I commend thee to God. Iune 18.</p>

               <p n="3">III. Beare with lighter faults for a time, till fit occaſion be offered to haue them amended.</p>

               <p n="9">IX. Receiue no opinion in religion, but what the Word euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly doth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: beware of apprehenſions out of thine owne witte, but let the Word firſt giue thee ſight, and ſo entertaine it, as thou art enlightened. As thou maieſt not of policie for feare of trouble, by thy witte get thee diſtinctions, to loſe ſinceritie where the Word is plaine: ſo mayeſt thou not of ſcrupuloſitie, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſin to trouble thy conſcience, and to vexe thee with feare of tranſgreſſion, where there is no law: the one doth breed Atheiſme, the other is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Let thy owne knowledge ground thy opinions in thee, and not in the iudgement of other: ſee into the glaſſe of the Word by thy owne ſight, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other mens ſpectacles, and hold what thou iudgeſt truth, only in loue of the truth; beware of by-reſpects: ſo hold the truth as neuer to bee remoued; but that which is erroneous in thee, be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Beware of raſh iudgement, neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne nor contemne other that are not as thy ſelfe. Thinke not to make thy gifts anothers guide, nor thy meaſure of grace their rule, for to euery man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted his portion.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Whomſoeuer thou doeſt ſee to do amiſſe, iudge it not to be of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but either of ignorance, and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to enforme them, or of infirmitie, and ſo pitie them, and pray for them Be charitable, ſo ſhall not his ſin hurt thee, and much ſhall thy charitie aduantage thy ſelfe in the end: and adde this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, Be ſlow to anger, let neuer another mans diſtempered paſſion bring thee to diſorderlineſſe in affection.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Loue not to be in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, it argueth pride and a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but if thou beeſt drawne vnto them and called thereunto, vndertake

               <p n="2">2. Take words doubtfull in the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, as the cauſe and circumſtances will beare: euident truth embrace wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, manifeſt errorrs deny plainly, likelihood of falſehood eſehew friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, likelihood of truth bend them the beſt way: peruert nothing wilfully, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy ignorance where thou art made to ſee, and yeeld the victorie when thou canſt not winne it without wicked Sophiſtrie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Bee ſure in anſwering that thou haſt the Authors meaning, either by which, or to which thou doeſt make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Alledge no teſtimonie raſhly, and eſpecially beware of this euill in quoting Scripture. Wreſting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a great abuſe of the Word; and if thou be in error, and doeſt by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures preſume to maintaine it, thou wouldeſt haue the truth to vphold falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and wickedly doeſt make the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt a maintainer of a lie.</p>

The other now liuing, was ſo diuided from him againe, as that hee brake fellowſhip with his brother, and with his owne father (who<note place="margin">
                        <hi>George</hi> his booke, page 6.</note> took part with his ſonne <hi>George</hi> againſt him, and curſed him with all the curſes

Oh dreadful beginnings and full of horror! Is the cauſe the Lords? There may bee contentions in the Church, &amp; amongſt the beſt: but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did not ſo farre euer runne.</p>
                  <p>Now that they be come to a certaine<note place="margin">Why God doth not now ſo deale in that high meaſure with the reſt.</note> head; whereto (as ſeemeth by the Lords croſſing their firſt beginnings, as he did <hi>Balaam</hi>) they haue now attained, as it were, whether God will or no. He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them, as he did <hi>Balaam,</hi> to goe on, and proceeds not ſo in that manner, by iudgement viſible. But doth God like that afterwards at any time, which at firſt he did hate? no ſurely: inſtance in <hi>Balaam,</hi> M. <hi>Bornit</hi> a Teacher died in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the plague, Gods fearefull corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting rod vpon offenders. And it may ſeeme that God would not haue had M. <hi>Smith</hi> to haue gone that way, by ſo often thwarting his iudgement. I. To publiſh in print on the Lords Prayer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14124:27"/> that way, and for as much. II. In falling into it after, againe vnder his hand to renounce the principles of that way called Browniſme. III. Brought againe to like it, but not wholly, for he held ſome true Church, ſome true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors here, and did diſlike the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true and falſe Church in reſpect of vs: then went hee, and conferred with certaine godly and learned men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became ſo ſatisfied, as he kneeled downe, and in prayer praiſed God, that he was not miſled farther, and was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, as hee purpoſed to diſſwade his Tutor M. <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> from the ſame, ſaying, hee would goe to Amſterdam for that end. This will be, and is confidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched by diuers then there preſent. Beſides theſe croſſes in iudgement, the Lord did chaſtiſe him with ſickneſſe nigh vnto death, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider better with himſelfe yet of his courſe: and this alſo was by ſome applied vnto him: and with all theſe, a dauntableneſſe of ſpirit with feare, not daring to be bold to ſuffer for the cauſe here with vs, did continually accompany him. Thus it ſeemeth, that God would more then by an ordinarie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14124:28"/> courſe taken, haue reclaimed him, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward diſtractions, or Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall outward meanes vſed to recouer him, might haue preuailed, but Gods ſecret counſell ſhall ſtand: behold the end. His owne former iudgement, his<note place="margin">Note well.</note> hand writing, his owne mouth in prayer to God, godly mens teſtimonies, Gods correcting hand, all theſe openly are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this hand of God may bee ſeene partly in ſuch as are miſledde that way. Some of them, in our way (which they call corrupt and falſe) were ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Lord, as they liued vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable from notable crimes: but comming to them, haue been forſaken of God (for what is it elſe?) that they did fall into very deteſtable vncleannes, as M. <hi>White</hi> mentioneth in his booke.</p>
                  <p>This I note, not that I thinke any Church can be pure, or that there is any ſinne, which the diuell may not draw ſome into, who make faire profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or that the whole aſſemblie there doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch: it is far from me ſo to thinke; but I therefore note it, as Gods teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with vs, where abiding truely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14124:28"/> God, or but making an apparent ſhew thereof, hee doth ſo preſerue vs heere, as we cannot be tainted (though no ſuch watch bee kept one ouer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as were to be wiſhed) with ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, as men that forſake vs (with ſuch condemnation as they doe, who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that way) do often dreadfully fall into. What is this but a likelihood of the Lords witneſſing againſt them?</p>
                  <p>Beſides this befalling ſome, there is an euill (the Lord open their eyes to ſee it) which hath ſeaſed vpon moſt of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> generallie, not onely that they cannot apprehend theſe things, but alſo herein, that as ſoone as they bee entred into that way, they are ſo therewith bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (that I may ſo ſay) as they bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like themſelues, in what was lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and good in them: before hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and tractable, then proud and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: before they can feele the Word worke, after if but inclinable that way, then they iudge the Miniſter to haue<note place="margin">Reade Doctor <hi>Downames</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Reader before his ſecond Sermon.</note> loſt the power of his Miniſterie, becauſe they themſelues are in affection altered: blaming the Teacher, when they are in fault themſelues. They can with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

That godly men ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chuſe them helpers to further their ſaluation, if any one open offender do ioyne with them therein. That if one man depart (after the manner) from one Church for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and ſo from all the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world, which are corrupted, the true Church doth remaine in him only. And many ſuch conceits taken vp as truthes with greedineſſe, when moſt manifeſt verities of God, confirmed by ſound reaſon, and explained by moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident ſimilitudes, cannot be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as either taſting of truth, or reaſon: What is this, but a ſpirituall beſotment?</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:14124:29"/>
                  <p>Before they bee in that fraternitie, they can feele in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues liuely markes of the children of God, and can iudge ſo of other, and ſo imbrace them: but then afterwards they can be content to be perſwaded againſt former faith, and ſenſible feeling, to thinke that neither they themſelues had, nor any other (out of their way) hath any outward markes of the children of God, &amp; ſo do fall into vtter diſlike of their owne former gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the goodneſſe of God in other, and the power of God, working by our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and all for that they be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of their parke; as if a Deere had loſt his ſhape, for not being within the pale, where perhappes hee ſhould be.

And for a great curſe, hee threatneth a famine of his word, not the taking away of a right conſtitution, Amos 8. 11. Nay our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did not forbid, or euer wiſh, either the Scribes and Phariſies not to teach at all, or the people not to heare them; but reprehends the one, and giueth libertie with caueats to the other, Matth. 23. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> hauing heard <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,</hi> they inquired not of what conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution hee was, but wherein hee did not ſufficientlie teach, they did better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, and incourage him to the work of the Lord, which was to preach by the Scriptures, not a conſtitution, but that Ieſus was that Chriſt. See the place Act. 18. 24. 28.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples that went and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14124:36"/> Act. 8. 1. 4. ſtoode not vpon euery ſpeciall point in entering ſo orderly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worke, as theſe men would haue it, without which they hold all as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. See verſe 12. neither did the people enquire thereof, but are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for hearing and receiuing the word, and for beleeuing in Chriſt Ieſus, Act. 17. 11. and 13. 43. 48.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, what in all the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is ſo vrged, ſo commaunded, ſo commended, ſuch promiſes of bleſſing annexed thereto? what made ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as the preaching and hearing of Gods word?

                  <p>This yet I ſpeake not, that men may<note place="margin">That which is the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, is to be preferred before the leſſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them to bee deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> runne out diſorderly, that euery man may take vpon him to preach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture (as very weake and ſimple men amongſt them preſume to doe) nor that obſeruation of order is a thing lightly to bee regarded. It is much to be wiſhed, that euery thing be done decently, in order, to Gods glorie,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14124:36"/> and the Churches edification: but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I thus written to magnifie the word preached as it deſerueth, aboue forme and faſhion, ſo it be not wholly vnorderly; and not to caſt off the one for want of exactneſſe in the other: this is for the tithing of mint, anniſe and cummin, to leaue waightier matters: (I ſpeake here comparatiuely betweene conſtitution and preaching) not, that I valew a right orderly proceeding at no more worth then anniſe and cummin; theſe ought to be done, but at no hand for want hereof to leaue the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, both to the extinguiſhing of the truth and the increaſe of ignorance, and alſo the intertainement of Poperie; which ſome of them, as hath been ſaid, would rather embrace, then to returne to vs againe, ſo great hatred is bred in them, againſt our way and ſtanding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the beſt things, which are all one as the worſt, to them; which, they ſay, are the deceiueableneſſe of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>

                  <p>Therfore muſt that one place, 1.

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt muſt herein be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, either as the practiſe was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or as he appointed it, by giuing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſome afterwards, elſe was hee not then vnderſtood, neither can now be; and we reade not of any, that did ſo practiſe after the letter, but after this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expoſition. Now the authoritie was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the chiefe Gouernours, and not in the bodie of the people, as appeareth in Ioh. 9. 22. &amp; 12. 42. &amp; 16. 2. And the commiſſion was giuen to certaine men,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14124:56"/> I haue declared, not to all; and <hi>Cloes</hi> complaint is made to the chiefe Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Apoſtle, and not to the bodie of the people, 2. Cor. 1. 11. Therefore it is rightly thus expounded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Sauiour hauing ſpoken in the third perſon, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> when hee commeth to ratifie the authoritie (to be committed by him, to his Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the benefit of the Church) hee turneth his ſpeech to the ſecond perſon, (not ſaying what <hi>it</hi> ſhall binde, &amp;c, but) what <hi>you</hi> ſhall binde and looſe; to wit, for the good of it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee ſpeakes alſo of a few, two or three gathered together, meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the officers of the Church, and not al the bodie, of which he would haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, had hee by <hi>Church</hi> meant indeede the bodie of the congregation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the 19. verſe he eſtabliſheth the authoritie of a few, for the good of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the officers, for the Church: for hee ſaith, <hi>If two of you ſhall agree,</hi> &amp;c. whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>they,</hi> that is, the Church, ſhal deſire, it ſhall be giuen vnto them, where is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a plaine difference in change of the perſon againe, betweene the officers of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14124:57"/> the Church, and the Church complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to haue things reformed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is neceſſarie to take it here figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely: 1. it doth agree to the practiſe of the Iewiſh Church (from whence it is held that the manner of gouerning in the Church is fetched), 2. For that, as you haue heard, it agreeth to Chriſts commiſſion giuen. 3. For the other reaſons before going, and the reſt following. 4. For order ſake, and to preuent confuſion: for as the prouerbe is, That which is all mens, is no mans: whereupon ariſeth great careleſneſſe in ſeeing vnto ſuch things, as are all mens in publike, as experience teacheth, both in Church and Common-wealth: yea by it pride, and thereupon contention inſueth. 5. To auoide the abſurdities, which elſe would neceſſarily follow out of the text, if the word <hi>Church</hi> ſhould not be expounded figuratiuely. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then all the whole Church muſt ſpeake to the partie offending: for it is ſaid, <hi>if hee will not heare the Church:</hi> by which it is plaine, that there by <hi>Church</hi> is meant ſuch as muſt ſpeake to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; how can hee elſe heare? But the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14124:57"/> whole Church cannot ſpeake ioyntly, that were confuſion, contrarie to the commandement, 1. Cor. 14. 40. nor ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally one by one: for then women muſt meddle in the Church cenſures &amp; ſpeak in the congregation, which is contrarie to 1. Cor. 14. 34: for they bee members of the Church, and it is not the whole Church without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yong youths, children and ſeruants; and if theſe are not to bee vnderſtood by the Church, then neceſſitie compelleth to take the word figuratiuely, the part for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole: and if one part may be left out, why not another, and ſo leaue out many, vntill the principall and chiefe of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be taken, who are choſen by the reſt, and may well bee the mouth of the reſt, and ſtand for the whole Church? Secondly, for that in the 19. verſe our Sauiour ſhould then croſſe himſelf, who giueth to two or three, that is, to a few the authoritie, which belongeth vnto all: for it is not enough that two or three agree to a thing, where all haue a right, but that all, or at the leaſt, moſt ſhould yeeld their conſent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14124:58"/> to the thing that is to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, if the word <hi>Church</hi> bee not taken here figuratiuely; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, firſt that the Corinthians offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being al commanded to deale with the inceſtuous perſon, 1. Cor. 5. 13. and yet but ſome of them did proceede againſt him, 2. Cor. 2. 6. Secondly, the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould offend, who vpon the complaint of <hi>Cloes</hi> houſe, did not waite for the Churches conſent, but of himſelfe abſent from them, conſidered of the matter, iudged of it, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what to bee done: for it is ſaid, <hi>I haue determined already,</hi> verſ. 3. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his ſentence to be executed there in the open congregation. Thus we ſee the figuratiue ſpeech good and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Chriſtian Reader with reaſon be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, this is the iudgement and the practiſe of all reformed Churches. And let not men maruell that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> officers ſhould be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: for firſt, it is no vnuſuall ſpeech to put the <hi>name of the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>whole vpon the part,</hi> and this to bee taken
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14124:58"/> for the whole. Secondly; a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie no where is called in all the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament a Church, (Chriſtian families excepted) but then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue their officers; otherwiſe they are called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, diſciples, but not a Church, but<note place="margin">Note this place. Act. 15. 22. 23.</note> only in Act. 14. 23. by anticipation, as heauen and earth are ſo called before they were, Gen. 1. 1. Therefore if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers giue to a companie the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Church, what great maruell is it, that by Church may be meant <hi>the Officers or Gouernours?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee the truth, contrarie to their aſſertion, plainly prooued; which cannot be wrung from me, but only by obiecting certain inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences, which<note place="margin">Certaine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters haue anſwered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Smith</hi> herein, who hath their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, which he hath not anſwered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as yet.</note> would follow hereupon, to the hurt of the Church.

Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle inſtructed by the Spirit of God, had not receiued any ſuch doctrine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, to teach vnto the people, as theſe men would picke out now from the holy word of God.</p>
                  <p>And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, this their poſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates that the ſin of one, doth diſſolue the bond of alleageance betweene God and another, for the Lord commands vs to worſhip him, to receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. Now it cannot bee prooued, that another mans ſinne freeth me from doing what I am commanded: let this be proued. May not I ſerue God, becauſe another man doth offend him? muſt I ceaſe to obey, becauſe another liueth in tranſgreſſion? It is without reaſon to thinke it.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee the ſtrongeſt reaſon for ſeparation, and the ground thereof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne. The Scriptures which are

                  <p>The places that forewarne Gods people <hi>vnder the law,</hi> to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are thus to bee taken: 1. From Idols of falſe gods, as Iſrael from Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Babyloniſh or heatheniſh gods, and Idolaters dwelling about them. 2. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Idols of the true God, as <hi>Iudah</hi> from Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time and after. 3.

                  <p>Secondly, it is ſtrange they ſhould taxe ſo generally without exception, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Congregation, and all the godlie people and ſeruants of Chriſt amongſt vs. He that runneth that way, had need<note place="margin">It containeth a deadly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of vs all, and in our ſtanding to be as void of comfort, as the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Papiſts.</note> of ſerious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, before he haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie entertaine ſo deadly a cenſure: for this carrieth ſo much with it, as the ſame ſecludeth vs all viſiblie, as farre from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſurance of ſauing grace, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the life of God, and the way which leadeth vnto euerlaſting ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as the Papiſt, &amp; do not they ſo iudge of vs? It appeareth by their continuall quoting of the ſame Scriptures againſt vs, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Spirit intendeth againſt Antichriſt and curſed idolaters, thereby abuſing ſimple honeſt hearts, leading them into this wofull cenſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and moſt accurſed vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe againſt vs: whereas wee find in the word, God called Iſrael his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after defection, and their children (in reſpect of circumciſion) his children Ezeck. 16. 21. 22. 2.

The Church of Chriſt is ſet out euen by the naming, that is, by the profeſſion of the name le-Chriſt: Rom. 15. 20. See how little hath God taken, to condemne thoſe, who will not hold vs a true Church, for that much which we haue.</p>
                  <p>But to the ſame more in particular I anſwere thus; That our aſſemblies are not falſe Churches, that congregation<note place="margin">What is a falſe Church.</note> which is falſe, hath a falſe head, falſe matter, falſe forme, and falſe properties: but this cannot be auouched againſt our congregations: for wee haue no falſe<note place="margin">We haue no falſe head.</note> head, we hold Ieſus Chriſt, and worſhip no other God, but the Trinitie in vnitie: If ſuch, as haue been of vs, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues may iudge of this trueth, doe yet denie the ſame, they neede rather corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The matter is not falſe: and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand<note place="margin">No falſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> this, we muſt note a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene no matter, true matter, and falſe matter.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That this is the true matter of the Church of God, thus I prooue.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Becauſe they beleeue the ſumme of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> which Goſpell, who ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth outward profeſſion of, are the true viſible matter: Rom. 10. 9. Ioh. 1. 12. and 3. 36. Ioh. 17. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Becauſe it was the doctrine alone by which the Apoſtles did gather peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make them a Church and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vnto Chriſt, Act. 2. 36. and 9. 20. and 19. 4. 5. and 18. 28. Luk. 24. 47. 1. Cor. 15. 3. and 3. 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Becauſe ſuch asmade profeſſion hereof, were without any ſtay or let, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the Church as true matter: Act. 8. 37. and 16. 31. 33. and 11. 26.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Becauſe he that doth make open
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14124:65"/> profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof, doth differ from Iewes, Turks, Pagans, yea and from Papiſts, for the former hold not Ieſus Chriſt to bee the ſonne of God, and theſe latter doe ioyne works in the cauſe of ſaluation, which is againſt the true nature of faith in the Sonne of God, and deſtroieth it. Rom. 10. 3. Gal. 3. 2. and 5. 2. 4. Act. 15. 1. 10. 11. And likewiſe againſt the truth of the Goſpell, Gal. 2. 14. 18, and 1. 6.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee by theſe reaſons, that ſuch<note place="margin">We are true matter of a true Church.</note> as make this profeſſion are true matter, and ſo are we; for wee all profeſſe this ſaith, and are baptiſed thereinto, as is appatrent: 1. By the doctrine of our Church, receiued by all the reformed Churches in the harmony of confeſſion. 2. By the ſame publickelie preached. 3. By the ſame maintained by our lawes, by writings, and euen ſealed with the blood of holie Martyrs againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and other hereticks: and therefore are we true matter of the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>Yet here againe note, that true matter<note place="margin">True matter is either good or bad.</note> is either good or bad, for who can deny, that to be true matter of building, which yet is not good? as timber and ſtone is true matter, but yet not ſome timber
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14124:66"/> and ſtone good matter: So is it in the ſpirituall building; all that thus profeſſe Chriſt, are true matter, but euery one not good matter: Such good and bad mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was in Corinth, and in the Church mentioned in the Reue. 2. 3. and hath bin in all the Churchs of God in the world, which bad matter by due proceeding, is either to be reformed, or elſe to be caſt out of the building, not as falſe matter, but as no good matter, though true; therefore a man excomunicate is caſt out not as falſe matter, but as bad and corrupt matter onely, and therefore is to be held a brother: 2. Theſ. 3. 15.</p>
                  <p>Neither let it ſeeme ſtrange, that the<note place="margin">Outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true faith, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man true matter of the viſible Church, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation he be bad matter.</note> outward profeſſion by word maketh men to be true viſible matter; whether they be hypocrites; for the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <hi>Simon Magus</hi> an hypocrite: Act. 8. and Chriſt Ieſus receiued <hi>Iudas:</hi> for many are called &amp; few choſen: Mat. 22. 14. or whether they be men of leaud conuerſation within the Church, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iuſtly to be caſt out, as bad matter; for that the Scripture calleth ſuch bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for their profeſſion: 1. Cor. 5. 11. Neither doth Chriſt (Reue. 2. or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14124:66"/> 1. Cor. 3. 12. 13. for corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of manners, or for building hay or ſtubble) cal them falſe matter. This may appeare in marriage of man &amp; woman, by which ſimilitude Chriſt ſetteth forth himſelfe and the Church.</p>
                  <p>Two perſons lawfully marrying, doe openlie by words acknowledge their conſent each to other, and doe profeſſe duties of loue in marriage; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the wife doth not performe the ſame as ſhe ought and did couenant: Is therefore the woman no true wife? She may be accounted vniuſt in her word, and not a good wife, but yet is ſhee a true wife, till the bond of marriage bee broken, and a bill of diuorcement bee giuen out.</p>
                  <p>A man profeſſing obedience to a king, acknowledging him his king and none other, and ſubiecting himſelfe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to his lawes, he is a true ſubiect to that king, albeit he doe tranſgreſſe in ſome things greatly and openlie, elſe kings in theſe daies ſhould haue but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie few true ſubiects.</p>
                  <p>A man that maketh profeſſion of one onely calling or trade, and of none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14124:67"/> by that onely profeſſion is he true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called that tradeſman, albeit hee bee but a bungler in his trade, or careleſſe in liuing by it: none will ſay that hee is a falſe tradeſman, but either no good tradeſman, or vnprofitable.</p>
                  <p>Euen thus is it in the profeſſion of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as is alreadie ſaid; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer doth profeſſe Chriſt, is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and true matter of a viſible Church, though neither good to other, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Good Chriſtian Reader, miſcarry not in thy iudgement from the truth onelie of a good affection deſirous to haue all well, and grieued at what is amiſſe: for thou ſhalt find euer cauſe thus to bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, whereſoeuer thou commeſt in in this vale of miſerie and corruptions.</p>
                  <p>Falſe matter is contrarie to this true<note place="margin">What falſe matter is.</note> matter.</p>
                  <p>The viſible forme is not falſe, which<note place="margin">The viſible forme &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Church is not falſe.</note> is the vniting of vs vnto God, and one to another viſiblie: For as by laying of the foundation in a building, and ſo the reſt vpon it, cemented together, maketh the forme of an houſe; ſo doth it in this ſpirituall building, called a houſe:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14124:67"/> 1. Pet. 2. 5. And that we are vnited vnto Chriſt, and made one with him it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Goe to the Scripture and ſee how a<note place="margin">By many eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent notes there be many which ſhew themſelues in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be of the inuiſible Church of God amongſt vs.</note> people are inuiſibly the Church of God, and ſecondly how viſiblie.</p>
                  <p>The forme of the inuiſible Church is the vnion betwixt God and man, and one with another, which is, firſt, <hi>by the ſpirit,</hi> by which inuiſible hand, God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly taketh vs by the heart, and ſaith, he will be our God, 1. Ioh. 4. 13. Ezech. 36. 27. Epheſ. 2. 22. &amp; 4. 4. 1. Cor. 12. 13. Galat. 4. 6. Rom. 8. 9. 2. <hi>By faith in Ieſus Christ,</hi> by which inuiſible hand, as many of vs as be regenerated, do take hold vpon the promiſe of the Spirit (Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath. 3. 14.) and of Chriſt (Epheſ. 3. 17.) beleeuing that we are his people, and he our God. For if we be in Chriſt, and hee in vs, wee haue vnion with the Father, Epheſ. 4. 6. Ioh. 17. 21. and with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, 1. Cor. 13. 13. and 6. 19. Rom. 8. 9. Thus God and man are inuiſiblie made one, and vnited. 3. One with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and that is, 1. As they be all knit to the head by faith, &amp; the Spirit, 2. As they take hold one of another by loue,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14124:68"/> and are bound together, Coloſ. 3. 4. Ioh. 13. 35. Thus is the viſible Church knit; and ſuch as God hath giuen his Spirit vnto (hauing true faith and loue) are the matter of the inuiſible Church, and the vnion by the Spirit, faith, and loue, is the inuiſible forme.</p>
                  <p>Now euen as the inuiſible forme is made, ſo anſwerablie the viſible forme ariſeth by ſuch things, as be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>God beginneth (Ioh. 15. 16) both the<note place="margin">Whence the viſible forme and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſeth.</note> inuiſible (as is declared) &amp; alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſible, and that is thus. As God inwardlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth by the holy Ghoſt, ſo firſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie by his word, which is the onely firſt viſible note and teſtimonie from<note place="margin">Goe giueth his word.</note> God, by which he makes a people his people (Pſalm. 147. 19. Rom. 3. 1. 2. Ioh. 17. 6.) It is his viſible hand ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out, to winne and ſubdue people vnto him (Rom. 1. 16. Matth. 28. 19. Mark. 16. 16. hence it is called the ſword of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirit, by which it ſmiteth, Eph. 6.) his meſſengers are his mouth, 2. Cor. 5. 20. promiſing to men, that God will take them to him, if they will receiue him; by this he begetteth vs, Iam. 1. 18.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14124:68"/> and therefore called the immortal ſeed, 1. Pet. 1. 23. By this he maketh vs aliue, Iohn. 5. 25. By this he reconcileth vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one; and therefore is it called the word of reconciliation: 2. Cor. 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is manifeſt, that where and to whomſoeuer God ſends his word, there he teſtifieth his loue, propounds ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is deſirous to make ſuch his people, and to plant there a Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, by the peoples open<note place="margin">A companie of people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, and profeſſe the faith.</note> profeſſion of their faith vnto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, God working in them a will to receiue it, in what degree ſoeuer: 1. Cor. 15. 1. Such a people haue viſibly taken hold of the word, and haue (as I might ſay) ſtrucken hands with God: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as internall faith is the inuiſible hand; ſo is externall profeſſion of that faith the viſible hand, ſhewing openly, that the word is taken hold off, and ſo a couenant made betweene God &amp; them. 2. Becauſe the Lords meſſengers the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (who in theſe things erred not) did take outward profeſſion of faith for faith, and ſo added Baptiſme, the Lords ſeale of forgiueneſſe (Acts 2. 38.) of new birth, (Col. 2. 11, 12. 1. Cor. 6. 11.) and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14124:69"/> of ſaluation (Tit. 3. 5.) thereunto, Act. 8. 12. 13. 37. 38. which they would not haue done, had they not been directed by the holy Ghoſt, to take the outward profeſſion of faith, for a ſtriking of hands as it were with God, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with him, howſoeuer it was in hypocriſie: for man ſeeth not the heart, neither did they ſtay to ſee their liues reformed, but only exhorted to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they outwardly profeſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, were not reiected: Act. 2. 38. Matth. 3. 6. 3. The Lord to ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his mercy, euen for receiuing the word from one, as Gods Miniſter: Mat. 10. 40, 41. and he promiſeth life to ſuch as openly confeſſe him: verſ. 32.</p>
                  <p>The third is, the holy Sacrament of<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeale it, and vniteth them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> the Lords Supper; which as it is a ſeale of our faith, ſo is it a teſtimonie of that viſible communion of loue, alſo of one member with another: 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. And thus is the vnin made viſibly, by which God and the people are one: and ſuch are a true Church gathered by the word, and vnited in communion by the Sacraments viſibly, by which they bee the viſible Iſraelites, as truely as the

The one is a true inuiſible Church before God, (though many of them deſerue correction for their euils, which God puniſheth in them, vſing his diſcipline, ſpirituall or outward croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but not making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no true church:) ſo is ſuch a people ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly profeſſing, and thus viſibly conioyned, a true Church (though many therein bee very bad, w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are to be corrected, but not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a falſe Church) being thus truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtituted both formatter &amp; form.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch congregations haue we, ſo profeſſing Ieſus Chriſt, (as is before ſaid) &amp; no otherwiſe, and alſo to which God hath giuen his owne holy word

                  <p>Laſtly, the viſible properties are not falſe: for the true viſible properties (which neceſſarily ariſe from the forme mentioned) are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Is continuance in hearing of the doctrine of Chriſt receiued, and vſing of the Sacraments and prayer: Iohn 10. 27. Acts 2. 42. 1. Cor. 15. 1. For as hereby the Church is begotten viſibly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, Matth. 28. 19. ſo when theſe do ceaſe, and men reiect them, they ceaſe to be a true Church of God: for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible teſtimonies of Gods ſpirituall loue tokens are taken away; and thoſe ſame hath he diuorced. Hence is it that all Diuines in our Church, and in all the reformed Churches in Chriſtendome (which now are or haue been) doe hold,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14124:70"/> that the true word of God preached, and true Sacraments of Chriſt Ieſus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, are infallible tokens of a true Church, and are reciprocally conuerted with the true Church. I doe not ſay a word preached, nor the word <hi>truely</hi> preached, nor the Sacraments <hi>rightly</hi>

Now this propertie is a true propertie which wee haue: for neither haue we, nor hold we, any other word or ſacraments, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe that be Chriſts
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14124:71"/> owne onely, and therein doe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                  <p n="2">II.

Whence it is, that the Church is called the pillar and ground of trueth: 1. Tim. 3. 15. And this propertie ariſeth neceſſarily from the forme, and is an eſſentiall marke: for when men doe vtterly leaue their open profeſſion, and partaking hereof, they ceaſe to be viſible members; for they haue reiected the viſible marks of Gods preſence and viſible communion with him.</p>
                  <p>Now this marke alſo is in our Church: for we doe hold out an open profeſſion of the true word, which is the word written in the holy ſcriptures, (not Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh vnwritten imagined veritie) and alſo the true ſacraments, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and whereſoeuer theſe two be, there are vndoubted markes of a true viſible Church, though no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties be apparent: and where theſe are wanting, there is no true viſible Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how farre from all truth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14124:71"/> it is, that they hold euerie of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to be falſe Churches, when it is manifeſt that with vs, there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregations, which haue true matter, true forme, and true properties, as euidently hath been declared from the word, and is apparent by our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practiſe herein.</p>

                  <p>This is an vndeniable trueth, that the<note place="margin">Diſcipline is not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Church, ſo as yet without it, the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a true viſible Church</note> care for the welfare of the Church, (which containeth the cenſures alſo, and the power of excommunication, termed by the name of diſcipline) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee proued (by euidence of Gods
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14124:72"/> word) to be ſuch a propertie as is of the eſſence of the Churches being, without which the Church muſt needes be a falſe Church: the vtmoſt that can be made of it is, that that Church is a defectiue Church, a maimed Church, by which it is alſo corrupt, and may come to ruine; but that a neceſſarie defect, can make it either no Church, or a falſe Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iuſtly be maintained.</p>
                  <p>It is a neceſſarie propertie of a man to ſpeake, it is for his welfare to ſee, to go; but yet, if hee can neither ſee, go, nor ſpeake; he is not therefore a falſe man. This diſtinction of true &amp; falſe, applied to our Church, is altogether friuolous and vaine: yet is it vpheld by them, as we ſee, againſt both Scripture, reaſon, and common ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then, if a neceſſarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, may be in part actually wanting to a true Church, &amp; yet ſuch a want not make that a falſe Church which wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth it: then cannot the ſupply of it howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, make that a falſe Church.</p>
                  <p>From all that hath been ſaid, we may obſerue: 1. That it is an error to make diſcipline ſo eſſentiall a propertie, as the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14124:73"/> Church without it, is no true, but a falſe Church: 2. To make our Church a falſe Church, becauſe diſcipline is ſo exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with vs, as it is contrarie to their new found popular Gouernment.</p>

Laſtly, thus did the Church in the election of <hi>Matthias,</hi> Act. 1. 23. 24. If any be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Church, and not firſt called of God, hee is the Churches Miniſter, and not Chriſts.

                  <p>This cuſtome did continue, in the times following in all the Churches of Chriſtendome, as Eccleſiaſticall writers doe make mention, and ſo thorow pure and impure Churches: yea God in vſing inſtruments, ſome what extraordinarilie, in the laſt reformation of his Church, would not breake this order; but hee choſe men, who were Biſhops, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euen in the Popiſh Church (I ſpeake of the Church of England, whereof the controuerſie is) ſo that they might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine fit perſons afterwards.

                  <p>But ſuch a practiſe is farre from the warrant of the Word; and where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.

No word of God inhibiteth from hearing ſuch as preach Chriſt Ieſus, and his trueth, to which Chriſt giueth witneſſe, by his bleſſing. In the Scripture it is ſet out as a marke of Gods child to heare the word, Ioh. 10. 27. and not a marke of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing excommunication, and to bee deliuered vp to the diuell. In the Word wee are exhorted to heare the word, to ſeeke it, Ioh. 6. 27. and men pronounced bleſſed that heare it, Luk. 11. 28. Reue. 1. 3. yea, no inhibiting by Chriſt for any to heare the Scribes and Phariſees, who peruerted the Scripture, Matth. 23. yea
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14124:86"/> the Apoſtle reioiced that Chriſt (that is, the truth) was preached, though it was done of contention, and with an intent to increaſe his afflictions. Now if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced at their preaching, ſuch as it was; ſurely he held not the people worthie to be cenſured that heard ſuch as ſo prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. The Apoſtle warneth to auoid an obſtinate Heretike; therfore except we be Heretikes and obſtinate Heretikes, we muſt be heard. If this their ſpeech, opinions, and euils be obſerued; we may better maintaine, that none of vs ſhould<note place="margin">We are not to heare them.</note> heare any of them, as Iere. 23. 16. They ſpeake (as Browniſts) their owne fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and viſions of their owne heart, and not truly out of the mouth of the Lord: and herein they goe on obſtinately and will not heare the Charmer, charme he neuer ſo wiſely.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, how can their Teachers bee preferred ſo to be heard as Miniſters of Chriſt before our Miniſters? God hath giuen no ſeale to them of their miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they conuert none to God; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert ſimple honeſt hearts alreadie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and doe ſteale away our labours in the Lord. When the Lord Ieſus hath
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14124:86"/> abundantly bleſſed his people here in conuerting them by our miniſterie; yet are ſome ſo fooliſh amongſt vs, as they will neither be moued by Scripture, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, their own feeling, nor Gods viſible teſtimonie by his bleſſing vpon many, to yeeld to the truth, which wee bring, if it croſſe their courſe any way. But in preiudice of our Miniſterie, in hatred of our courſe, and too great a conceited loue to their owne deuiſed way, they contemne and reiect the iudgement of both learned and godly men amongſt vs, as either blind, not hauing their eyes as yet opened, or put out againe by the god of this world, if ſo be a man know<note place="margin">Why they dare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne men ſo much that knowe their way, and ſet themſelues againſt them.</note> their way and will not ioyne himſelfe with them. For they doe take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that hee which knoweth their way muſt needes know it for the way of the Lord; vpon which falſe imagination, they doe preſumptuouſly cenſure, and dare boldlie condemne men, which know the ſame, and either do ſpeake or write againſt it; as men ſhould, or elſe yeeld themſelues, and giue the cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. <hi>That it is not lawfull to ioyne in prayer with any of vs:</hi> that is, though they

                  </p>
                  <p>This is againſt the wiſedom of God, who allowed a ſetled maintenance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law: and there is nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. <hi>That our Churches ought to bee raced downe, and not to be imploied to the true worſhip of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The maine reaſon for this aſſertion, is by making equall Paganiſme, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme, which being taken for granted, they do vrge the Scriptures in the old Teſtament, vttered againſt the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14124:87"/> Heathen Temples, to race downe our Churches. But there is great difference betweene Antichriſtianiſme, and Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme; for this was the worſhipping of a falſe god, and without any profeſſion of the true God: but the other worſhip the true God, and hold many truthes of God. Paganiſme was wholly without the Church, but Antichriſt ſits in the Church of God, ſo as the Church of God had a part in thoſe things, when they were built, to keepe poſſeſſion for<note place="margin">Note this.</note> the Lord in his creatures, which they did abuſe to idolatrie and falſe worſhip; and therefore there is more cauſe to purge them, holding the right which we haue by the godly, before vs in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then to race them, becauſe the wicked did abuſe them. But grant there be no difference, yet it muſt be proued that our Churches were built by Antichriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we pull them downe: elſe all the Scriptures alledged are but miſapplied.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of this, and all other their Browniſticall opinions, which I here haue ſet downe by themſelues, to acquaint thee with them, that ſo thou maiſt diſcerne and iudge of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their way

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Church of England is<note place="margin">Our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: for</note> a true Church of Chriſt, and ſuch a one as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer wittingly and continually ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth himſelf, cutteth himſelfe off from Chriſt, wee doubt not but the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader may be perſwaded by theſe reaſons following:</p>
            <p>Firſt, we enioy and ioyne together in<note place="margin">1 We haue and ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the vſe of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> the vſe of thoſe outward meanes, which God in his word hath ordained, for the gathering of an inuiſible Church. For proofe whereof, wee alleadge that the meanes which wee vſe and enioy haue been effectuall to the vnfained conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many: as may appeare both by the other fruites of faith that may bee
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14124:91"/> found amongſt vs, and by the martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which ſundrie haue indured, that were members of our Church, and had no other meanes of conuerſion, then ſuch as wee haue. Yea euen theſe men who iudge ſo hardly of vs now, are able to witneſſe with vs in this caſe, that if there bee any true faith and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them (though it be much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as they thinke) ſince they left vs) yet it was begun and bred in our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if theſe places of the holie Scripture, Mat. 28. 18. 20. Eph. 4. 11. 14. be well examined, it will be found that the meanes which Chriſt ordained for the gathering of an inuiſible Church, are the very ſame which we inioy, euen the preaching of the Word, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments. That which <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> ſaith againſt vs in this point, page 160. of his <hi>Diſcouerie, viz.</hi> that there is not any one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs either in order or adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to Chriſts Teſtament, ſhall be hereafter diſproued, when wee ſhall come to iuſtifie our miniſterie of the Word and Sacraments, againſt their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14124:91"/> arguments or obiections whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Now that this is a good &amp; an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible<note place="margin">Which is an infallible note of a true Church.</note> argument of a true Church appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: 1. Becauſe there can no people be named that hauing theſe meanes, may yet (by the word) be euicted not to haue been the true Church. The Papiſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed brag of theſe meanes, but without cauſe: for the doctrine of faith is not preached amongſt them, but oppugned, and conſequently they cannot haue the true Sacraments which are ſeales of that righteouſneſſe which is by faith. 2. The Scripture euery where ſpeaketh of the preaching of the Word, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments, as of priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges peculiar vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of God <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3. 1. 2. &amp; 9. 1. Pſal. 147. 19. 20.</note>. So while the Iewes onelie were the Church, theſe priuiledges were reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, and neuer made common to the Gentiles, till (the partition wall being broken downe) they alſo were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated to the Church of God <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 10. 5. 6. Act. 11. 19. &amp; 13. 46. 47.</note>. So the Prophet ſaith, that this ſhould bee the reaſon whereby the Gentiles were moued to ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto the true Church, becauſe there (&amp; no where elſe) the miniſtrie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word was to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <note n="c" place="margin">Eſay 2. 2. 3.</note>.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:14124:92"/>
            <p>Secondly, our whole Church maketh<note place="margin">2 We make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true faith.</note> profeſſion of the true faith. The confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Church, together with the Apologie thereof, and thoſe articles of religion which were agreed vpon in the Conuocation houſe in the yeere of our Lord 1562. (whereunto alſo euery Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the land is by law bound to ſubſcribe, ſo farre foorth as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the doctrine of faith and of the Sacraments) doe proue this euidently: for how ſhall wee better iudge of the faith which our Church profeſſeth then by ſuch euidences? Many Papiſts and Atheiſts are in our land (wee grant) and many ignorant and wicked men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, who make not ſo cleere and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a profeſſion of the true faith as they ſhould; but that our Church accounteth any one for her childe or member, who either denieth Chriſt, or profeſſeth any other way to ſaluation, then faith which worketh by loue, or who doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this faith in ſome meaſure, that doe we confidently denie. Now this reaſon alſo hath force ſufficient to proue vs the<note place="margin">Which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to proue a true Church.</note> true Church. For as true faith in Chriſt is that which giueth the life and being to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14124:92"/> ſuch as are effectually called, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come members of the inuiſible and elect Church; ſo the profeſſion of true faith is that which giueth life and being vnto a viſible Church. Vpon this profeſſion we finde many haue been incorporated into the viſible Church, and admitted to the priuiledges thereof, euen by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelues, (Act. 8. 37. 38. &amp; 16. 31. 32. &amp; 8. 12.) Yea euen <hi>Simon Magus</hi> though he neither had faith nor the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, yet becauſe he made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, was iudged a member of the viſible Church, and baptiſed (Act. 8. 13.) So the Church of Pergamus though it had groſſer defects and corruptions in it then we haue any, yet becauſe it kept the name of Chriſt and denied not his faith, was ſtill called the Church of God, Reuel. 2. 12. 15.</p>
            <p>The deſcription of a Church which they giue in the 67. page of their colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of letters and conferences, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a companie of faithfull people that truly worſhip Chriſt and readilie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him; is vtterly vntrue, if it bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood (as needs it muſt) of the viſible Church. For if euery one that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14124:93"/> may account a viſible member be trulie faithfull; how is our Sauiour to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth the Church, or the miniſterie thereof to a draw net, which being caſt into the ſea, gathereth as well that which muſt be caſt away, as good fiſh? (Matth. 13. 47. 48.) and to a field, wherein the diuell doth as buſilie ſow tares, as the Son of man doth good wheate? (Matth. 13. 37. 39.) How ſhall that difference ſtand which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh (1. Sam. 16. 7. Act. 15. 7. 8.) betwixt the Lords iudgement and the iudgement of man, if men may not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count any to be members of the Church by their outward appearance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, vnleſſe they know them to haue true faith, which thing the Lords eye only is able to diſcerne?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we hold and teach, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note place="margin">3 We hold and teach all truthes fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.</note> againſt all Heretickes and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, euery part &amp; article of Gods holy truth, which is fundamentall, and ſuch as without the knowledge and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing whereof there is no ſaluation. Our Confeſſions, Catechiſmes, Articles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion publiſhed and approued of in our Church, may perſwade all indifferent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14124:93"/> men of this. Yet was not <hi>H. Barrow</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to write in the tenth page of his <hi>Diſcouerie; That all the lawes of God, both of the first and ſecond Table are here bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and reiected both of the Eccleſiasticall and Ciuill estate, and of euery particular perſon in both; all things being innouated in both, according to the lustes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of men, the law and word of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite reiected and cast aſide.</hi> And in the 212. page of their refutation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Gyfford,</hi> they haue theſe words: <hi>We hold that you haue poyſoned all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of ſincere doctrine, and peruerted the whole Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and turned away the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thereof, by your damnable falſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, yea that you teach not one point ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely.</hi> And in the 162. page of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, <hi>They are made ſo contrarie one</hi>
               <note place="margin">A lying Spirit.</note> 
               <hi>vnto another, as it is an impoſſible thing to finde two of them of one minde, yea or any one of them constant in that hee affirmeth: they know not the doctrines euen of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Christ.</hi> Adde hereunto <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Barrows</hi> words in the 12. and 13. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their collections of letters and conferences.</p>
            <p>We wil not giue any anſwere to theſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14124:94"/> ſpeeches, but onely deſire the Chriſtian Reader to conſider, whether euer Gods<note place="margin">Reader conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well, and the Lord giue thee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to diſcerne of ſpirits.</note> Spirit taught any to write ſo ſlanderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not only againſt a whole nation (the conuerſion whereof they pretend to ſeeke) but againſt the bleſſed truth of God: and how vnlikely it is, that they ſhould be in the right way, whoſe chiefe Leaders were guided by ſuch a ſpirit; that they ſhould be the Lords building, whoſe firſt founders and maſter builders had either ſo ſmall skill, or ſo bad a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Do wee not hold all the ſame bookes of Canonicall Scripture which they themſelues hold? Do wee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect out of the Canon of the Scripture, all which themſelues account Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall? Haue they any tranſlation of holy Scriptures beſides ours? Do they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues beleeue or reach otherwiſe in the article of the holy Trinitie, of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or predeſtination then we do? Hath euery member of their aſſemblies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that ſpirit, whereby they are led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth, as <hi>H. Barrow,</hi> (pag. 167. of his Diſcouerie) affirmeth? and is there not any one amongſt vs, that hath not quite reiected the whole word of God?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14124:94"/> not any one that knoweth the doctrines euen of the beginnings of Chriſt? Wee know no better way to conuince them in this, then by appealing thus vnto their owne conſcience, which wee are ſure will take our part againſt them.</p>
            <p>Now this reaſon alſo is ſtrong to<note place="margin">Which none can do but the true Church.</note> proue vs a true Church: for although the bare letter of the Scripture may bee found amongſt the Iewes, and Papiſts, and other Heretikes; yet was there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any other people that held &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the true ſenſe of the Scripture in all points fundamentall, but onely the Church of God; wherunto only this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle belongeth, to be the pillar &amp; ground of truth, 1. Tim. 3. 15. Wherein wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire<note place="margin">Note this.</note> the Reader to conſider, that a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may bee the true Church, though they know not, nor hold not euerie truth contained in holy Scripture, but contrarily hold many errors repugnant to the Scriptures: yet hath <hi>H. Barrow</hi> affirmed (in the 167. page of his Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie)<note place="margin">Then is not he, nor his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, the true Church and people of God, for they maintaine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors amongſt themſelues obſtinately, and do groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths againſt vs, now Gods Spirit is not lying. 1. Ioh.</note> that, <hi>to the people of God and euery one of them, God hath giuen his holy ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Spirit, to open vnto them, and to leade them into all truth.</hi> Whereby it is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14124:95"/> euident, that he would haue none to be accounted the people and Church of God, who either know not, or practiſe not euery truth contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In which opinion, ſee (I pray you) how many groſſe and dangerous errors are contained. Firſt, that to euerie infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour member in the Church, there is as much reuealed, as to the Paſtours and chiefe members; whereas the Apoſtle affirmeth (Rom. 12. 3. Epheſ. 4. 7. 16. Coloſ. 2. 19.) that the holy Ghoſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to euery member of the bodie of Chriſt, not equally, but proportionally, as the place which it occupieth in the bodie doth require. Secondly, that the promiſe mentioned, Ioh. 16. 13. was made to euery member of the Church, which in the laſt words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth plainly, to be peculiar to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Thirdly, that the Church cannot erre, &amp; ſo neither were the Corinthians rightly called the Church of God, when they iudged corruptlie of fornication, and of the reſurrection; neither they of Pergamus, when the doctrine of <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> was maintained amongſt them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Paul</hi> nor the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14124:95"/> true members of the Church, who (though in the exerciſe of their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall function, they could not erre) yet knew but in part, and in many things were ſubiect to error: 1. Cor. 13. 9. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrange opinion is maintained in the 156. and 157. pages of their Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>euerie trueth contained</hi>
               <note place="margin">An error full groſſe, with ſlanders and lies.</note> 
               <hi>in the Scripture is fundamentall.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we affirme not (as he there ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth vs) that ſome part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more holy, more authenticall, or more true then other; yet doubt we not to ſay, that ſome parts are of more vſe and more neceſſarie for men to know, then other ſome. Elſe why doth the holie Ghoſt giue ſpeciall commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome parts more then he doth to other, as a Song of Songs? Why<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 1. 2. Tim. 2. 11. Titus 3. 8.</note> doth hee vſe ſpeciall Art in ſetting downe ſome parts rather then in other? as Pſalm. 111. and 112. and 119? Why doth he (as it were) make proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſolemne Oyeſſes before ſome, and not before other? as Mark. 4. 3. 1. Tim. 1. 15. and 4. 9. And although we doe not hold (as they falſeſlie charge vs<note place="margin">Still falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.</note> in the forenamed pages of their Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14124:96"/> that ſome parts of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are of ſmall moment, ſuperficiall, needleſſe, and of no neceſſitie, and ſuch as may be altered and violated without any preiudice and danger to the ſoule; and much leſſe that a man, who hath obſtinately continued in the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome parts, and openly taught the ſame vnto others, may be vndoubtedly ſaued, though hee die without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But on the contrarie we beleeue and teach, that there is no part of holie Scripture, which euery Chriſtian is not neceſſarily bound to ſeeke, and deſire the knowledge of, ſo farre foorth as in him lieth; yet dare wee not call euery truth fundamentall; that is, ſuch as if it be not knowne and obeyed, the whole religion and faith of the Church muſt needes fall to the ground. For we make no queſtion, but that both the penitent Theefe that was crucified with Chriſt, and the Eunuch, euen then, when hee was baptiſed by <hi>Philip,</hi> were in the ſtate of ſaluation, though they could not chuſe but be ignorant of many truths in religion.</p>
            <p>The only fundamentall truth in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14124:96"/> is this: <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, who took our nature of the Virgine Mary, is our onely and all ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, they that receiue this truth are the people of God and in the ſtate of ſaluation; they that receiue it not, cannot poſſibly be ſaued, Matth. 16. 18. Mark. 16. 16. 1. Ioh. 4. 2. Coll. 2. 7. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is no other point of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion neceſſarie otherwiſe, then as it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neceſſarily to the bringing vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or confirming vs in the aſſurance of this one trueth, Ioh. 20. 31. Epheſ. 2. 20. Hebr. 13. 8. 1. Cor. 2. 2. And therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith (Ephe. 2. 19. 21.) that the Church is built vpon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophets and Apoſtles; his meaning is, not to call euery thing contained in their writings the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, but that this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of is there to bee found, and hath witneſſe from thence; and that all the writings and doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets doe bend vnto, ſtay, and reſt vpon this one truth, as the walles in the building doe vpon the chiefe corner ſtone.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:14124:97"/>
            <p>Laſtly, al the knowne Churches in the<note place="margin">All reformed Churches giue teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnto vs.</note> world acknowledge our Church for their ſiſter; and giue vnto vs the right hand of fellowſhip. This <hi>H. Barrow</hi> and <hi>Iohn Greenwood</hi> denie in the 14. page of their Refutation: but they name not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Church that maketh queſtion of vs. Indeed ſome of them affirme that we want ſome parts of the diſcipline, which we haue not yet (as they thinke) ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly receiued, as wee ſhould haue done: but whether wee were the true Church or no, neuer was there yet any reformed Church that made queſtion. Yet are they well acquainted, by our bookes, by the report of ſuch as haue trauelled from hence, and ſundrie other waies, with our doctrine, and Liturgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Neither doe they only forbeare to ſhew their diſlike to vs, or are content to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue ſocietie with vs (which happily through humane infirmitie they might doe vpon ſiniſter reſpects, though they approued not of vs in their iudgement) but they doe alſo hold and teach, <hi>that what people ſoeuer hath ſo much as we haue, is the true Church, though their wants be as great, as ours are iudged to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:14124:97"/>
            <p>Now when we alleadge for our ſelues<note place="margin">Which ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argueth that we be the true Church.</note> the teſtimonie of the Churches, we doe not thereby (as theſe men fondly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in that 14. page of their Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) make the words of men the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Church, nor doe we vſe this as our only or chief defence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſeek to approue our ſelues, either vnto the Lord, or to the conſciences of his people: but ſuch an argument wee hold this to be, as in the due place, hath much force in it, and as God himſelfe hath ſanctified for a principall helpe in the deciding of controuerſies in this kinde. The Apoſtles vſe to alleage it as a matter of comfort to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom they write vnto, that the Churches of Chriſt do ſalute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (Rom. 16. 16. 1. Pet. 5. 13.) that they were famous, and had the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie and good report of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (Rom. 16. 19. 1. Theſ. 1. 7. 8. 3. Ioh. 6. 2. Cor. 8. 18. 19. 23. 24.) S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though hee receiued not his calling either from men, or by men (Gal. 1. 1.) nor was any whit inferiour to the chiefe Apoſtles; (2. Cor. 11. 5.) yet doth hee alleage for the credit of his miniſterie, that three chiefe Apoſtles approued him, and gaue
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14124:98"/> to him the right hand of fellowſhippe: (Gal. 2. 9.) yea hee ſought alſo their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and feared that without it, hee ſhould haue runne in vaine (Gal. 2. 2.) And which is yet more, hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to winne commendation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit euen to thoſe orders, which hee by his Apoſtolicall authoritie might haue eſtabliſhed, by the example and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other Churches. (1. Cor. 7. 17. and 11. 15. and 14. 33. &amp; 16. 1.) If theſe Churches, that were planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelues, might take comfort in the good opinion that other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had of them, may not wee much more? If the miniſterie of <hi>Paul</hi> and the orders hee preſcribed to the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued further credit with the people of God, by the approbation of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ſhall not the teſtimonie of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reformed Churches giue ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the miniſterie and orders of the Church now?</p>
            <p>The doctrine &amp; word of God, though (to ſpeake properly) it receiueth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie only from it ſelfe, and the Spirit of God; yet hath it euer been the rather receiued by men, for the teſtimonie that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14124:98"/> the Church hath giuen vnto it. So our Sauiour ſaith, that <hi>Wiſedome is iustified of her children.</hi> (Mat. 11. 19.) And although he affirmeth that <hi>he receiueth not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of man,</hi> (Ioh. 5. 34.) yet in reſpect of the ſaluation and good of men, hee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it neceſſarie that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſhould giue teſtimonie vnto him. (Ioh. 1. 7. 8. and 5. 33. 34.) Now if this one thing furthered the damnation of the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Iewes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would not heare nor receiue Chriſt, though teſtimonie were giuen vnto him, by one who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew to be ſent of God; ſhall not this<note place="margin">Great pride is it and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Elſe, why did the Church at Antioch in a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that could not be debated at home, ſeeke to the Church at Ieruſalem for helpe; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing they had two ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men with them, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> whoſe iudgement they might ſafely
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14124:99"/> haue truſted vnto? (Acts 15. 2.) Saith our Sauiour to any particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull in our owne land, that <hi>Whatſoeuer they binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> (Mat. 18. 18.) and ſaith hee it not alſo to the Churches of other nations?

Muſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Prophets be ſubiect to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets amongſt whom they liue? (1. Cor. 14. 32.) and muſt not both people and Prophets of a particular Church be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the iudgement of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Churches in the world?</p>
            <p>The abilitie to trie and diſcerne the ſpirits and doctrines of ſuch Teachers as ariſe in the Church, is ſuch a gift, as the true Church neuer wanted, (1. Ioh. 4. 1. Reu. 2. 2.) neither could it be the pillar and ground of truth, (1.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14124:99"/> Church of God.</hi> If God hath giuen his Church power to iudge and pronounce of a particular man, that he is in the ſtate of ſaluation, and that ſo infallibly, that hee hath promiſed to ratifie in heauen the iudgement which the Church in this caſe ſhall giue vpon earth, (Mat. 18. 18.) hath hee not much more made his Church able to diſcerne and pronounce of a congregation or people, that it is a true viſible Church, which is a matter of no ſuch difficultie as the other?</p>
            <p>So that (to conclude) though theſe men make ſo light account of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and teſtimony of other Churches, as if the word of God had come out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, or vnto them only (1. Cor. 14. 36.) or, as if they themſelues were better able to iudge of vs, then all the godlie learned in the world beſides; yet do we take much comfort and aſſurance from hence that wee are the true Church of God.<note place="margin">The firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole body of our Church, that it was not rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing they obiect againſt the whole bodie of our Church, and of our pariſh aſſemblies is this: That it was not gathered by ſuch meanes as God in his word hath ordained and ſanctiſted
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14124:100"/> for the gathering of his Church. For (faith <hi>H. Barrow</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 10. page of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie) all this people were in one day with the blaſt of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> trumpet, of ignorant Papiſts, and groſſe idolaters made faithfull Chriſtians, and true profeſſors. And in the 3. page of that Epiſtle to the Reader, which they haue prefixed to their refutation of M. <hi>Gyfford,</hi> they haue theſe words: Where ſuch prophane multitudes were all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from publike idolatry, at one inſtant receiued, or rather compelled to be members of this Church in ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or other, without any due calling to the faith, by the preaching of the Goſpell going before, or orderly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together in the faith, there being no voluntarie or particular confeſſion of their owne faith and duties made or required of any: who can ſay that theſe Churches were euer rightly gathered or built according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rules of Chriſts Teſtament?</p>
            <p>To all that they thus obiect againſt<note place="margin">But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not warrant their ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> our firſt gathering, this anſwere wee giue:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that we might lawfully bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14124:100"/> a true Church, though it could<note place="margin">Becauſe the knowledge of this is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be ſtood vpon.</note> not appeare that wee were at the firſt rightly gathered. For euen as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples might bee well aſſured of Chriſts bodily preſence amongſt them, when they ſaw and felt him (Ioh. 20. 19. 28.) though they could not haue diſcerned which way or how hee could poſſiblie come in; ſo may we eſteeme them a true Church, of whoſe preſent profeſſion and faith we are well aſſured; though wee cannot ſee, by what meanes they were firſt gathered. Elſe may wee ſtill doubt whither <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and the families of <hi>Iob,</hi> or <hi>Cornelius</hi> were true Churches and members of the Church; becauſe we cannot find how they were firſt gathered and conuerted, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede can wee ſee by what commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Gods word wee are required to examine how they were gathered and made a Church: of whom wee are now certainly perſwaded that they were a Church. Nay we find good warrant in the Word to the contrarie. For wee read of many, who (hauing by that they heard and ſaw, perceiued euidently that a people was the Church of God) did
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14124:101"/> ioyne themſelues willingly vnto them, without inquiring how they were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and conuerted: as <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchiſedech, Rahab</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch to <hi>Philip,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iaylor to <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, wee might be rightly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered<note place="margin">Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, then by the meanes which are moſt ordinary.</note> to the ſocietie and fellowſhip of the viſible Church, by other meanes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the preaching of the Goſpell: for proofe whereof wee alleage, firſt their owne iudgement and opinion, (which, how vnſound ſoeuer it be, yet hath it force enough to ſtoppe their mouthes) namely, that men may be wonne to the true faith of Chriſt, not only extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, but euen ordinarily alſo by other meanes, then the publike and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall preaching of the Word. For if ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall members may bee conuerted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this meane, may they not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without it bee gathered together and made an aſſembly? Secondly, admit there were no other meane whereby a man could bee ſoundly conuerted, but only preaching, yet it is euident, that by ſome other meanes men may lawfullie bee brought to an outward profeſſion, and ſo be made a viſible Church. Many
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14124:101"/> in the daies of Chriſt beleeued, (that is, were prepared to heare and beleeue) and did alſo ſo follow him and profeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues his Diſciples, that no man could without ſinne haue denied them to bee members of the viſible Church, who yet were not all drawne by his word, but ſome by his miracles (Ioh. 2. 23. 25) ſome by the report they heard of him (Ioh. 4. 39): ſome by the deſire they had to bee fed by him (Ioh. 6. 24. 26.) Since Kings became nurſing Fathers, and Queenes nurſing Mothers to the Church, their lawes haue been meanes to bring men to the outward ſocietie of the Church; and the parable proueth, that men may bee compelled to come (Luk. 14. 23.) Now as many hearing of the ſame of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> and of Chriſt, came to them and ſo were conuerted by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo many that for feare of law were firſt brought to the Church, &amp; outward profèſſion of the truth, haue bin and are effectually conuerted by the miniſterie of the word.<note place="margin">Thirdly, Our Church was gathered by ſuch meanes as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, our Church was gathered by the preaching of the word. For the firſt conuerſion of our land to the faith of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14124:102"/> Chriſt, was by preaching of the Goſpel, as is manifeſt by the teſtimonie of the beſt approued hiſtories. Since that time many haue from age to age been called by the ſame meanes: as by the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Maſter <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and ſuch like. For proofe whereof this may ſerue, that in moſt of the Kings daies there haue been ſome which haue indured martyrdome for the truth. Theſe ſecret ones did ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other ſecretly, ſo long as perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continued; and ſhewed themſelues openly, when libertie was granted. In the daies of King <hi>Edward</hi> great numbers were by preaching ſo effectually called, that in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> raigne many ſimple men and women were able to manifeſt the truth againſt the learnedſt Papiſts, and to ſeale it with their blood. Beſides them, there were ſundrie ſecret congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in many parts of the land, all the daies of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> which gladly receiued and openly profeſſed the Goſpell, offered to them by publike authoritie at her Maieſties entrance to the Crowne. If it be ſaid, that they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> to be the true Churches of Chriſt, becauſe they ioyned themſelues and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14124:102"/> became one bodie with ſuch as were newly come (and that not of conſcience but for feare only) from idolatrie: Wee<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> anſwere, that they rather that had fallen from the Goſpell in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, were moued by Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> proclamation to ioyne themſelues vnto them that had ſtood faithfully all that while. Neither is it truly ſaid of<note place="margin">Another vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth of theirs</note> them, that in one day by the blaſt of her Maieſties trumpet at the beginning of her raigne, all ſorts of men were drawne to a profeſſion of the Goſpell, without any further meanes vſed. For before any were compelled to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, which was not til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Midſommer after her Maieſtie came to the Crowne, there were not onely many Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſent into all the parts of the land, that might deface all the monuments of Idolatry, but ſundry Preachers alſo (that in the daies of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued approbation, and exerciſed their miniſterie in ſome of the beſt Reformed Churches beyond the ſeas) did by their doctrine both keepe them (whom they found conuerted) in the profeſſion of the truth, and called many others: Of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14124:103"/> which number wee may reckon Maſter <hi>Knox, Leuer, Gilbie, Sampſon, Whittingha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Goodman</hi> and ſundrie others. And there are daily many added to the Church by no other meanes then by the miniſterie of the word preached. So that if this were a good reaſon againſt many other particular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers or whole aſſemblies, yet can it not iuſtifie a ſeparation from all, ſeeing wee haue many that by the preaching of the Word were conuerted and gathered.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this being prooued, that<note place="margin">Fourthly Though the meanes vſed for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Church, had not been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the firſt calling of a people to the ſaith, yet were they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had fallen from the faith, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> there was a true Church in this land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Maieſties raigne; the queſtion muſt not bee whether the meanes ſhee vſed were the right meanes, for the firſt calling and conuerting a people to the faith; but whether ſhe tooke not a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſe for the recalling and reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her ſubiects vnto thoſe true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, whoſe fellowſhippe they had forſaken. This was the courſe that <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> tooke, (2. Chron. 17. 7. 9.) who (to gather the Church who was decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſent Preachers into ſundry parts of his Kingdome, and appointed Noble men to accompany and aſſiſt them, by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14124:103"/> countenancing their miniſterie, and compelling the people to heare them. This courſe alſo did <hi>Ioſiah</hi> take, who hauing aboliſhed idolatry, compelled all his ſubiects to the ſeruice of the true God, (2. Chron. 34. 33.) Thus did <hi>Aſa</hi> vſe his authority in commanding Iudah to ſeeke the Lord, and to doe according to the law and the commandement, (2. Chron. 14. 4.) and threatning them with death that ſhould refuſe, (2. Chro. 15. 13) So did <hi>Ezechias</hi> by his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, bring diuers of Iſrael to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, who were before ſeparated from the Church of God, (2. Chron. 30. 11, 12.)</p>
            <p>Fiftly, where as they ſay, that at the<note place="margin">Fiftly, though the ſolemne couenant to renounce ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and to cleaue to the truth, be not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: yet was that alſo required and performed in our firſt gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> beginning of her Maieſties raigne, the people ſhould haue been required by ſolemne othe and couenant to renounce idolatrie, and profeſſe faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpell, after the example of <hi>Aſaes</hi> reformation: Wee anſwere: firſt, that if it had been abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the being of a Church, that there ſhould bee ſuch a ſolemne couenanting by othe to renounce idolatrie, this courſe ſhould haue been taken in that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14124:104"/> reformation, which <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Ioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> made as well as in that of <hi>Aſa.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, euen as where that othe was taken, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people were Gods true Church before the time of that othe and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: ſo may our people be. For the couenant made and the othe taken by <hi>Aſa,</hi> wee reade, was made and taken in the 15. yeere of his raigne (2. Chron. 15. 10. 12.) when yet his ſubiects were the true Church of God long before: 2. Chr. 14. 2. 4. 2. Chron. 15. 17. and 15. 9. Thirdly, there be diuers Congregations in our land, which in the beginning of her Maieſties daies, and ſince, haue publikely profeſſed their repentance for their former idolatrie, and promiſed to imbrace and obey the trueth, as it is preſently eſtabliſhed, as in Couentry, Northampton, and ſome other places. Yea, we doubt not to affirme, that the whole land in the Parliament held in the firſt yeer of her Maieſties raigne, did enter into a ſolemne couenant with the Lord, for renouncing of poperie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing they obiect againſt<note place="margin">The ſecond obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole bodie of our Church is, that it vſeth a worſhip of God that is polluted, with the writings of men, as read ſtinted prayers, &amp;c.</note> the whole body of our Aſſemblies, is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14124:104"/> this: That they communicate together in a falſe and idolatrous outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which is polluted with the writings of men, <hi>viz.</hi> with read ſtinted prayers, homilies, catechiſmes, and ſuch like; which in the 244. page of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, they call the ſmoke of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit.</p>
            <p>To this ſecond obiection wee giue this anſwer:</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is euident by the word, that<note place="margin">But this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot warrant their ſeparation, for Firſt, ſtinted and ſet forme of words is lawfull in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie praier.</note> the Church hath vſed, and might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vſe in prayer and Gods worſhip, a ſtinted and ſet forme of words. For we finde a forme of bleſſing the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Prieſts, (Num. 6. 23, 24.) a forme of confeſſion to bee vſed at the bringing of the firſt fruits to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, preſcribed to the people, (Deut. 26. 3. 15.) a Pſalme appointed for the Prieſts and Leuites to vſe euery morning, (Pſal. 22. 1. as <hi>Tremel.</hi> interpreteth, &amp; the title of the Pſal. ſheweth) another to be vſed euery Sabbath day, (Pſal. 92.) So in the thankſgiuing vſed at the bringing home of the Arke, vnto the place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it by <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Church tied themſelues to the verie words of the
